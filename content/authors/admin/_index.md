I am a PhD student in the Data Analytics and Machine Learning (DAML) group at the Technical University of Munich, where I work with Prof. Stephan GÃ¼nnemann. My research centers on uncertainty quantification in machine learningâ€”essentially, I'm trying to figure out when models know that they don't know something. I am particularly interested in an information-theoretic view of machine learning, which provides principled foundations for understanding uncertainty and knowledge in AI systems.

Currently, I'm exploring this question in the context of large language models (LLMs). I'm fascinated by the challenge of understanding when these models are truly confident versus when they're just producing plausible-sounding text. My goal is to develop both theoretical frameworks and practical systems that can reliably detect and communicate uncertainty, making AI systems more trustworthy and safer to deploy in real-world applications.

I completed both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at TUM, where I built a strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning. Beyond research, I'm driven by the vision of creating AI systems that don't just perform well on average, but that also know their limits and can say "I don't know" when appropriate.
