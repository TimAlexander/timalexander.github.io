abstract: 'Background Volume of interest (VOI) segmentation is a crucial step for
  Radiomics analyses and radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning. Because it can be time-consuming
  and subject to inter-observer variability, we developed and tested a Deep Learning-based
  automatic segmentation (DLBAS) algorithm to reproducibly predict the primary gross
  tumor as VOI for Radiomics analyses in extremity soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Methods
  A DLBAS algorithm was trained on a cohort of 157 patients and externally tested
  on an independent cohort of 87 patients using contrast-enhanced MRI. Manual tumor
  delineations by a radiation oncologist served as ground truths (GTs). A benchmark
  study with 20 cases from the test cohort compared the DLBAS predictions against
  manual VOI segmentations of two residents (ERs) and clinical delineations of two
  radiation oncologists (ROs). The ROs rated DLBAS predictions regarding their direct
  applicability. Results The DLBAS achieved a median dice similarity coefficient (DSC)
  of 0.88 against the GTs in the entire test cohort (interquartile range (IQR): 0.11)
  and a median DSC of 0.89 (IQR 0.07) and 0.82 (IQR 0.10) in comparison to ERs and
  ROs, respectively. Radiomics feature stability was high with a median intraclass
  correlation coefficient of 0.97, 0.95 and 0.94 for GTs, ERs, and ROs, respectively.
  DLBAS predictions were deemed clinically suitable by the two ROs in 35% and 20%
  of cases, respectively. Conclusion The results demonstrate that the DLBAS algorithm
  provides reproducible VOI predictions for radiomics feature extraction. Variability
  remains regarding direct clinical applicability of predictions for RT treatment
  planning.'
